<h1>About JCUP plugins collection</h1>
This plugin represents a collection for all de-jcup plugins available on eclipse marketplace. 
<br><br>
Because the marketplace needs at least one required plugin but users should not forced to install
a plugin they didn't want to, this little help was marked as required plugin. So all other plugins
are free to select.
<br><br>
